Q: How to transform the task-specific short-term memory to general and robust long-term memory?

\section{background}
Humans and animals are excel at remembering past experiences. On the other hand, current artificial intelligence 
lacks such memory capability, and thus we need to implement such functions. It is known that human first create short-term memory 
in hippocampus and transfer the short-term memory to neo-cortex, gradually consolidating the long-term memory 
\cite{Helfer20,Kitamura17,Tonegawa18,Josselyn20}. Therefore, implementing these functions artificially may work well 
to create an agent with good memory. The question here is, how to make a robust long-term memory from a short-term task-specific memory?
