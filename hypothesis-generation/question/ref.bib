% A possible explanation for why it takes longer to lay down a memory trace in neocortex is that it is more sparsely inter-connected than the hippocampus, and that creation of a memory trace therefore
% Another possibility, suggested by Teyler and Rudy (2007), is that strong inhibitory control mechanisms in the neocortex slow down the induction of LTP.
% most authors favor a view where the hippocampus does not store memory content, but rather “indices” (Teyler & Discenna, 1986;
% Teyler & Rudy, 2007) or “links” to loci in the neocortex where components of memory traces reside (Alvarez & Squire, 1994; Frankland & Bontempi, 2005)

% We found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells, which are critical for remote contextual fear memory, 
% were rapidly generated during initial learning through inputs from both the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex network and the basolateral amygdala. 
% After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. 
% Whereas hippocampal engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which were necessary for fear memory, were maintained.
