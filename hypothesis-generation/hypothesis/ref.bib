% the hippocampus contains a group of neurons that encode an index of neocortical neurons activated during the original experience. The reactivation of these hippocampal neurons facilitates the reactivation
of corresponding neocortical neurons and in turn, triggers
memory retrieval. These hippocampal neurons are unique in
their selectivity for a specific experience (but not precise location), their coordinated activity during an experience and
subsequent sleep, and their experience-triggered activation
of intracellular signalling associated with synaptic plasticity.

%  empirical research has so far provided conflicting findings on the permanence of the hippocampal index
code.

% Collectively, studies using manipulation and monitoring
approaches provide evidence for the gradual maturation of
memory traces in the neocortex. Memory encoding induces
enduring structural changes in neocortical synapses over
weeks, which parallels the refinement of the selectivity of
neocortical neurons for memory content. During this process, the commonality among multiple similar memories is
extracted, leading to the gradual development of generalizable knowledge of the external world in the mPFC. Such
prior knowledge enables similar, new memories to be rapidly assimilated into what had already been learned, thereby
speeding up systems consolidation processes

% Overall, substantial evidence from electrophysiological
studies supports the proposed hippocampalâ€“neocortical dialogue during offline periods after memory encoding. In both
the hippocampus and neocortex, precise spiking patterns
during experiences are preferentially reactivated when the
hippocampus exhibits ripples, and bi-directional interaction
between the two regions determines the exact patterns to be
reactivated. Moreover, the two regions also interact with one
another during the retrieval of consolidated memories.

% The mechanisms for pattern completion and pattern separation are described 
in the context of a theory of hippocampal function in which the hippocampal CA3 system operates 
as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any spatial location 
(place in rodents, or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide for completion of the whole memory 
during recall from any part.

	abstract = {Neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex behave stochastically even during precise perception and reliable learning of animals. While studies have revealed advantages of these stochastic features, relationship and synergy of them remain elusive. Here, we show that these stochastic features are unified into a framework to provide an efficient and biologically-plausible learning algorithm that consistently explains various experimental findings of the brain, which includes statistics of cortical circuit and the most efficient power-low encoding of cortex. The algorithm can be regarded as an integration of major branches of existing algorithms of neural networks, back propagation learning and Boltzmann machine, while it overcomes known limitations of them. As an experimentally testable prediction, slow retrograde modulation of excitability of neurons is also derived. We anticipate that the algorithm is, due to its simplicity and flexibility, beneficial to develop neuromorphic devices or scalable AI-chips, and bridges the gap between neuroscience and machine learning.},
