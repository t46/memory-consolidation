# Hypothesis
We can transform the task-specific short-term memory to general and robust memory if we
- encode temporal information
- enforce agents not to use long-term memory directly
- protect long-term memory by changing network

A natural consequence is that language is complementary to long-term memory. Language manipulation may help 
to preserve long-term memory.
